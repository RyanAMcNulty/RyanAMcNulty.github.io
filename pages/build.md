This page will describe all the steps that went into building this website for self reference as well as guidance for others.

To update gh repository (and subsequently the website itself):
{% highlight bash %}
% git add .
% git commit -m "message goes here"
% git push origin gh-pages #gh-pages is name of branch where all website file are stored... still working to understand branches and general git architecture
{% endhighlight %}
